# Databricks Python Notebooks CI/CD Pipeline Demo

This repository demonstrates the CI/CD pipeline process for a team of data engineers collaboratively working on Python notebooks. The pipeline facilitates the seamless transition of notebooks from a development environment, through testing, and into the production Databricks workspace. It automates deployment, ensures code quality, and integrates testing, allowing multiple engineers to push their changes with confidence.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps and PowerShell to automate the following stages:
1. **Development**: Python notebooks are pushed by multiple engineers to the development workspace in Databricks.
2. **Testing**: The notebooks are validated in the dev environment to ensure correctness and functionality.
3. **Production**: Once testing passes, the notebooks are automatically deployed to the production Databricks workspace.

The demo includes:
- YAML pipelines for managing deployments.
- A PowerShell script for securely handling Databricks tokens and deploying notebooks.
- Error handling and logging to ensure transparency and debuggability.

## Files and Structure

### 1. `cicd-pipelines.yml`

This file defines the overall CI/CD pipeline with stages for:
- **Deploying to the Development Environment**: Deploys Python notebooks from the repository to the Databricks development workspace.
- **Running Tests**: Ensures the notebooks work as expected in the development environment.
- **Deploying to the Production Environment**: Deploys the tested notebooks to the production Databricks workspace.

**Key Features**:
- Conditional triggers to ensure stages are only run when needed.
- Artifact handling for better traceability of deployments.
- Error handling and retry logic to ensure resilience.

### 2. `deploy-notebooks.yml`

This file handles the deployment of notebooks to the Databricks workspace via Azure CLI and PowerShell scripts. It:
- Retrieves Databricks workspace information and tokens securely.
- Deploys notebooks from a specified directory to the target workspace.
- Supports both development and production environments.

**Key Features**:
- Secure token retrieval from Azure Key Vault.
- Deployment logs and error tracking for troubleshooting.
- Modular and reusable structure for handling different environments.

### 3. `DatabricksToken.ps1`

This PowerShell script securely retrieves the Databricks bearer token from Azure Key Vault and handles the deployment of notebooks into the Databricks environment.

**Key Features**:
- Secure token retrieval, eliminating the need for hardcoded credentials.
- Modularized code for easy maintenance.
- Error handling and logging to capture any issues during deployment.

## Pipeline Flow

### Trigger
The pipeline is triggered whenever changes are made to the `main` branch.

### Stages
1. **Deploy to Development**:
   - The notebooks are deployed to the Databricks development workspace.
   - The deployment is logged, and errors are caught and displayed.

2. **Run Tests**:
   - After deployment, the notebooks are validated with tests to ensure they function correctly.
   - Only if the tests succeed, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage.

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   - The notebooks are deployed to the Databricks production workspace.
   - This stage only runs if the previous stages succeed.

### Artifacts and Logging
- Logs and artifacts (such as notebooks) are published at the end of the pipeline for debugging and verification.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- **Azure DevOps**: Set up with access to the required environments (Dev and Prod).
- **Azure Databricks**: Both development and production workspaces configured.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Store Databricks token securely for authentication.
- **PowerShell**: PowerShell environment for executing scripts within the pipeline.
- **Azure CLI**: Installed and configured for managing Azure resources.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Azure DevOps Pipeline
- Add the YAML files (`cicd-pipelines.yml` and `deploy-notebooks.yml`) to your Azure DevOps pipeline.
- Ensure that variable groups for both the development and production environments are properly configured.
- Modify the resource group, environment names, and paths as needed.

### 2. Set up Azure Key Vault
- Store the Databricks bearer token in an Azure Key Vault.
- Update the `DatabricksToken.ps1` script to reference your Key Vault and token name.

### 3. Run the Pipeline
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the pipeline.
- Monitor the pipeline stages to verify successful deployment and testing.

## Customization

- **Notebook Paths**: Modify the `notebooksPath` in the YAML files to change the location of the notebooks.
- **Testing**: Add custom testing scripts in the `Run_Tests` stage to validate the notebooks based on your specific use case.
- **Error Handling**: Customize error handling logic in the YAML and PowerShell scripts as needed for your environment.

## Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Ensure that all notebook changes are versioned using Git to avoid conflicts and manage multiple engineers’ contributions.
- **Environment Separation**: Keep development and production environments isolated to avoid unintended impacts.
- **Secure Token Management**: Use Azure Key Vault or another secure secret management solution for all sensitive credentials.

## Future Enhancements

- **Parallelization**: Future versions could parallelize notebook deployment and testing to improve efficiency.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Integrate more detailed logging and monitoring with Azure Monitor or another logging solution.
- **Notebook Linting**: Add automated notebook linting as part of the testing phase for improved code quality.

## Conclusion

This demo provides a scalable and secure CI/CD pipeline for Python notebooks in Azure Databricks, ensuring quality and consistency across multiple engineers’ contributions. The modular design and error-handling capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of team structures and project requirements.
